Implementation:
Resnet50 model:
Resnet technique was used to train the model. Google drive was mounted into the workspace to allow access of dataset stored in Google drive. Preprocessing was done by ImageDataGenerator and pixel values are normalized from 0 to 1 with rescaling. Loaded the training images and testing images from the kidney stones dataset. A pretrained ResNet50 model was loaded from keras, and the images are inputted into 224,224,3 and is freezed to further avoid any changes during the training process. A new model is created with a global average pooling layer and for binary classification a dense output layer with a sigmoid activation function . Compiled and trained the new model with batch size of 73 with 10 epochs and saved it. To verify the performance of the trained model the data of test images is loaded and ImageDataGenerator for test data is used to preprocess the data. The trained model is then evaluated with test data. The accuracy and loss of the model are printed.
Analysis of the Kidney Stones Detection Model:
1. Data Preprocessing: The code employs the `ImageDataGenerator` from TensorFlow to preprocess and augment training images. The generator is configured to rescale pixel values to the range [0, 1]. The `flow_from_directory` function is used to load training images from the specified directory, with a target size of (224, 224) pixels.
2. Transfer Learning with ResNet50: The pre trained ResNet50 model which is  obtained from the `keras.applications` module, is loaded. This architecture is known for its deep structure and excellent performance on image-related tasks. All layers of the ResNet50 base model are frozen to retain pre-trained weights during subsequent training.
3. Model Architecture: A new model is constructed by adding a Global Average Pooling layer and a Dense layer with a sigmoid activation for binary classification on top of the ResNet50 base. The resulting model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss, suitable for binary classification tasks.
4. Model Training: The model is trained using the `fit` method with the training data generated by the ImageDataGenerator. Training is performed for 10 epochs. The training history is stored in the `history` variable for potential analysis of accuracy and loss trends.
5. Model Saving: After training, the model is saved in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) with the file name "Kidney_Stones_ResNet_model.h5" for future use or deployment.
 
              



Expected output:
The training process should exhibit decreasing training loss and increasing accuracy over the epochs, reflecting the model's learning. The saved model file can be employed for predictions on new kidney stone images. Monitoring the training history (accuracy and loss) can aid in assessing the model's convergence and potential overfitting. Evaluating the model on a separate validation set is recommended for a comprehensive performance analysis.
  

Analysis:
 
Upon loading the test dataset and configuring a data generator, the model undergoes evaluation using the `evaluate` method, which yields the test loss and accuracy. The resulting `test_accuracy` becomes a pivotal metric, representing the model's ability to generalize to previously unseen data. Interpreting the test accuracy is crucial, as a higher value suggests robust generalization, indicating the model's proficiency in correctly classifying images outside its training set. This metric serves as a benchmark for the model's overall performance on new instances. Here, we achieved an accuracy of 0.57 and test loss 0.68 and it depicts it is a good model.
To delve into the specifics of individual predictions, the model utilizes the `predict` method, generating probability scores for each instance. These probabilities are subsequently converted into binary predictions using a threshold of 0.5. Sample predictions are then presented, providing a direct comparison between the model's predictions and the actual classes of the test images. The analysis of sample predictions offers a nuanced view of the model's performance on a case-by-case basis, uncovering potential strengths and weaknesses. Examining instances where the model deviates from actual classes can provide insights into areas for improvement or highlight specific challenges in the classification task.
In practical applications, accuracy and individual predictions play a pivotal role in determining the reliability of the model for real-world scenarios. Furthermore, more advanced evaluation techniques, such as confusion matrices or precision-recall curves, could be employed for a deeper understanding of the model's performance across different classes. Overall, the provided code and its subsequent analysis contribute to a comprehensive assessment of the CNN model's efficacy in handling new and previously unseen data.â€ƒ
CNN model:
1. Model Architecture: The model consists of convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes, followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction. Additional convolutional layers increase the model's capacity to capture hierarchical features. Dense layers at the end are responsible for classification based on learned features.
2. Activation Functions: ReLU activation is used throughout the convolutional layers, introducing non-linearity to the model, and aiding in feature learning. The final dense layer uses a sigmoid activation, suitable for binary classification, producing a probability output.
3. Pooling Layers: Max pooling reduces spatial dimensions, retaining dominant features, and promoting translation invariance.
5. Adjustability: The model's architecture can be modified based on the specific requirements of the image classification task. Hyperparameters like filter sizes, the number of filters, and units in dense layers can be adjusted for optimal performance.
6. Training and Evaluation: The model needs to be trained on labeled data using an appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics. During training, the model learns to minimize the chosen loss, and evaluation on a separate dataset assesses its generalization ability. Model performance can be improved by tuning hyperparameters, increasing dataset size, and utilizing techniques like data augmentation.

Interpretation:

Let's interpret the results of the above SVM model:
Accuracy (Overall Performance): The overall accuracy of the model is approximately 91.41%, which is a good indication of how well the model is performing across both classes (normal and kidney stone).

Precision:
Precision for Class 0 (Normal): 87% Out of all instances predicted as normal, 87% are truly normal. The remaining 13% are false positives (instances predicted as normal but are actually kidney stones).
Precision for Class 1 (Kidney Stone): 99% Out of all instances predicted as kidney stones, 99% are truly kidney stones. The remaining 1% are false positives (instances predicted as kidney stones but are actually normal).

Recall:
Recall for Class 0 (Normal): 99% Out of all actual normal instances, the model correctly identifies 99% of them. Only 1% of normal instances are missed (false negatives).
Recall for Class 1 (Kidney Stone): 81% Out of all actual kidney stone instances, the model correctly identifies 81% of them. However, 19% of kidney stone instances are missed (false negatives).

F1-Score:
F1-Score for Class 0 (Normal): 93% The harmonic mean of precision and recall for normal instances.
F1-Score for Class 1 (Kidney Stone): 89% The harmonic mean of precision and recall for kidney stone instances.
Confusion Matrix:
   [[165   1]
    [ 24 101]]
    
True Negatives (TN): [165] Instances correctly predicted as normal.
False Positives (FP): [1] Instances predicted as kidney stones but are actually normal.
False Negatives (FN): [24] Instances predicted as normal but are actually kidney stones.
True Positives (TP): [101] Instances correctly predicted as kidney stones.


Analysis for SVM model:

The model performs very well in correctly identifying normal cases (high precision and recall). For kidney stones, the precision is very high (few false positives), but the recall is slightly lower (some false negatives). This suggests that while the model is very accurate when predicting kidney stones, it might miss a few cases. These results are promising, and further fine-tuning or exploration of different algorithms might help improve performance further.

Random Forest Classifier:
 
Output :
 
Interpretation :

The Random Forest model results obtained are as follows:
Accuracy: [84.88%] The overall accuracy of the model on the test set.

Precision : 
Precision for Class 0 (Normal): [80%] Out of all instances predicted as normal, 80% are truly normal. The remaining 20% are false positives (instances predicted as normal but are actually kidney stones).
Precision for Class 1 (Kidney Stone): [96%] Out of all instances predicted as kidney stones, 96% are truly kidney stones. The remaining 4% are false positives (instances predicted as kidney stones but are actually normal).

Recall :
Recall for Class 0 (Normal): [98%] Out of all actual normal instances, the model correctly identifies 98% of them. Only 2% of normal instances are missed (false negatives).
Recall for Class 1 (Kidney Stone): [68%] Out of all actual kidney stone instances, the model correctly identifies 68% of them. However, 32% of kidney stone instances are missed (false negatives).

F1-Score :

F1-Score for Class 0 (Normal): [88%] The harmonic mean of precision and recall for normal instances.
F1-Score for Class 1 (Kidney Stone): [79%] The harmonic mean of precision and recall for kidney stone instances.

Confusion Matrix:
  [[162   4]
   [ 40  85]]

   
True Negatives (TN): [162] Instances correctly predicted as normal.
False Positives (FP): [4] Instances predicted as kidney stones but are actually normal.
False Negatives (FN): [40] Instances predicted as normal but are actually kidney stones.
True Positives (TP): [85] Instances correctly predicted as kidney stones.

Analysis for Random Forest Classifier model:

The model has a high accuracy, but there is a trade-off between precision and recall, especially for kidney stone cases. Precision for kidney stones is high, indicating that when the model predicts kidney stones, it's often correct. However, recall for kidney stones is lower, indicating that the model may miss some cases of kidney stones. Consider the specific requirements of your application; if false positives are more critical, the model's performance might be acceptable.

Model Evaluation:

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved an impressive accuracy of 91.41%. It demonstrated a high precision of 99% for predicting kidney stones, indicating that when the model labeled an instance as a kidney stone, it was correct 99% of the time. However, the recall for kidney stones was 81%, suggesting that the model missed some instances of kidney stones in the dataset. The F1-score, a harmonic mean of precision and recall, was 89%, striking a balance between the two metrics.
On the other hand, the Random Forest model showed an accuracy of 84.88%. It exhibited a high precision of 96% for kidney stones, comparable to the SVM model. However, the recall for kidney stones was lower at 68%, indicating a higher number of false negatives. The F1-score for kidney stones was 79%, reflecting the trade-off between precision and recall.

Analysis:

Comparing the two models, the SVM model demonstrated superior performance in terms of overall accuracy and precision for kidney stones. Its ability to correctly classify normal cases and accurately identify kidney stones contributed to its high accuracy. However, the Random Forest model, while achieving a slightly lower accuracy, showed competitive precision for kidney stones.

The choice between these models depends on the specific goals and considerations of the application. If the emphasis is on minimizing false positives (misclassifying normal cases as kidney stones), the SVM model may be preferred due to its higher precision. On the other hand, if the goal is to reduce false negatives (identifying all instances of kidney stones), the Random Forest model might be considered despite the lower recall.
It's important to note that the performance metrics and the choice of the "better" model depend on the specific context of the application and the consequences of false positives and false negatives. Additionally, further model tuning and exploration, as outlined in the future scope, could potentially enhance the performance of the models. â€ƒ
